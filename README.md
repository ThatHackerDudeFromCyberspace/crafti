Switch the current inventory slot with 1 and 3  
Open a list of blocks with "."  (Screenshot with CTRL+.)
Set the current inventory slot with 5 while the block list is open  
Put a block down with 7 (or select) and destroy a block with 9  
Open the menu with menu, move the cursor with 8-2 and select it with 5  
The +/- buttons let you change the render distance

## Crafti now supports keyboard and mouse input with an OTG cable:
Note: This is experimental and may not work as expected

Move around using WASD like standard minecraft  
Jump using space  
Switch the current inventory slot with Z and C  
Open a list of blocks with E (screenshots are possible with CTRL+E and CTRL+.)  

Place a block with 7, select or LEFT MOUSE CLICK  
Remove a block with 9 or Q  
+/- let you change the render distance  
Open the menu with R, move the cursor with the arrow keys and select it with left click or enter  
Menus can also be navigated with WASD  

ESC is still a shortcut for "Save & Exit"  


Limitations
-----------

crafti doesn't use floats, so there will be some graphical inaccuracies.


TODO for next version
-----------
- [x] Add wool
- [x] Add experimental keyboard support
- [ ] Add stairs
- [ ] Add villager house generation to make world more lively
